# Servlet creation problems

### Problem 1

Create a part of an application – a task organizer for execution. It should provide the ability to add tasks (id, title, description, deadline for execution), with the data stored in a collection suitable for the purpose.

Create the following servlets:

· Servlet for adding a new task (AddTaskServlet). To be accessible at URL \<project url>/tasks/add;

· Servlet for viewing an added task by a given id (ShowTaskServlet). To be accessible at URL \<project url>/tasks/view;

· Servlet for viewing all added tasks (ShowAllTasksServlet). To be accessible at URL \<project url>/tasks.

Test the created functionalities using Postman.
