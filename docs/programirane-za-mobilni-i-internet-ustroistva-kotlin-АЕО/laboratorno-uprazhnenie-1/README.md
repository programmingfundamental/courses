# Laboratory lesson 1

## Short info

Kotlin programming language is focused on clear definitions, brevity and safety.

Kotlin creatores considered various design decisions in order to help programmers in robust code creation. For example, null-pointer exceptions could cause financial losses and serious computer crashes, leading to countless hours of debugging. So Kotlin distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable data types, which helps catch more errors at compile time. Kotlin is strongly typed and includes lambdas, co-programs, and properties, which allow writing less code with fewer errors.


Kotlin has been in development since 2011 and was released as an open source project in 2012. Version 1.0 was released in 2016, and Kotlin has been an officially supported language for building Android applications since 2017. It is included in IntelliJ IDEA as well as Android Studio.


Kotlin code compiles so that Java and Kotlin code could be used side by side and it's possible to still use Java libraries. Kotlin code could be added to an existing Java program, or if the program should be completely migrated, IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio include tools for this.
