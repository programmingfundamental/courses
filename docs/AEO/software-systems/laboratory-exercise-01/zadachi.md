# Individual Tasks

### Task 1

Extend the Calculator application by adding buttons for subtraction, multiplication, and division that perform the corresponding arithmetic operations on the entered values and display the result.

### Task 2

Implement validation of the input fields so that only numeric values are accepted, and display an appropriate message when invalid data is entered. For the division operation, add a check for division by zero and prevent the calculation from being performed.
