# Laboratory lesson 1

### SOLID principles

The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his work from 2000, "Design Principles and Design Patterns". This concept was later refined by Michael Feathers, who introduced the acronym SOLID. Over the past 20 years, these five principles have revolutionized the world of object-oriented programming, changing the way software is written.

What is SOLID, and how does it help in writing better code?

Put simply, Martin's and Feather's design principles encourage the creation of software that is easier to maintain, understand, and flexible. Therefore, despite the inevitability of applications growing in size, their complexity decreases!

The SOLID principles indicate how functions and data structures should be arranged in classes and how these classes should be interconnected.

The use of the term "class" does not mean that these principles only apply to object-oriented programming. A class is simply a related grouping of functions and data. Every software system has such groupings, whether they are called classes or not. The SOLID principles apply to these groups of functions and data, and even to a lower level such as a function or data structure, which we will refer to as elements of the software.

The following five concepts constitute the SOLID principles: 

**S** Single Responsibility principle

**O** Open-Closed principle

**L** Liskov Substitution principle

**I** Interface Segregation principle

**D** Dependency Inversion principle
